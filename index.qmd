## Background

Left/right differences in the brain have fascinated thinkers for generations. Zebrafish genetic tools harnessed within the epithalamus of the forebrain has led to the habenula's emergence as a powerful paradigm to understand brain lateralisation. During development, the habenula forms bilaterally as a pair of left and right nuclei, along with a medial pineal gland and left-sided parapineal nucleus that emerges from the pineal.

### The parapineal organ

A substantial body of research in zebrafish unequivocally identified the parapineal organ (also known as the "parietal eye" in other organisms) as a crucial determinant of habenular left/right asymmetry. Through an unidentified mechanism, the parapineal organ signals to newly-born habenular neurons to adopt "left-sided" characteristics. This elusive signal is potent and precise within a defined developmental time window, from approximately 28 to 32 hours post-fertilisation. Abrogation of the parapineal signal during this event leads to a complete loss of left identity, resulting in a "double right" 4-days-old habenula.

### The *sox1a* gene

Zebrafish *sox1a* mutants have "double right" habenula *despite the parapineal forming normally*. This finding was important as it uncoupled the parapineal's signalling function from its anatomical development. Therefore, *sox1a* mutants can be utilised as a tool to reveal the parapineal signal which is crucial to understanding how habenula neurons acquire left-sided character.

### Current work

Identification of the parapineal signal has previously eluded the field due to non-trivial technical challenges. With fewer than 20 cells per zebrafish embryo, isolating a pure population of parapineal cells of sufficient quality to interrogate their genetic content was monumentally difficult. By combining modern single cell sequencing technologies with prior expertise in characterising small cell populations from zebrafish embryos, I overcame these challenges to illuminate a cohort of biological factors responsible for parapineal function in the context of epithalamic asymmetry.
